# The body mass index (BMI) was created by a Belgian mathematician in the 1850s and it's used by health and nutrition professionals to estimate human body fat in certain populations.
# It is computed by taking an individual's weight (mass) in kilograms and dividing it by the square of their height in meters.
# bmi=height2massâ€‹

# Create a bmi.py program that calculates your own BMI.

mass = 81
height = 1.76

bmi = mass / (height**height)
